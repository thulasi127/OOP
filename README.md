# OOP
Object Oriented Programming Work

Bank Account program:
A java program that explores the Object-Oriented programming concepts of Inheritance and Encapsulation. I have written a test-driven program that replicates a Bank Account including both Savings and Checking accounts as its subclasses. This has helped me to better understand how to inherit and override superclass methods, invoke superclass constructors, and learn about protected and package access control. The project is executed using Gradle and also incorporates JUnit testings and Exception Handlings.
